# Global Trends Analysis Project

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of global trends, focusing on key factors such as CO2 emissions, economic indicators, and wealth distribution. The project explores the intersection of environmental impact and economic growth over time.

## Project Structure

The analysis is organized into three main sections:

1. **CO2 Emissions Growth:**
   - Investigates the growth of CO2 emissions globally and by income group.
   - Analyzes both total CO2 emissions and per capita emissions.

   ```python
   # Example code snippet
   sns.lineplot(data=income_country, x='year', y='co2', hue='country')
   ```

2. **CO2 Emission Share by Country:**
   - Explores the share of CO2 emissions for the top 5 emitting countries.
   - Provides insights into both total emissions and emissions normalized by population.

   ```python
   # Example code snippet
   sns.barplot(data=top5_emitters[year], x='country', y='co2', color='skyblue')
   ```

3. **Wealth Inequality Development:**
   - Examines the distribution of GDP per capita across countries from 1950 to 2020.
   - Illustrates changes in wealth distribution over 10-year intervals.

   ```python
   # Example code snippet
   sns.violinplot(x='gdp_per_capita', y='year', data=filtered_data_positive, orient='h', linewidth=1.5, width=0.8, inner='quartile', color='lightgreen')
   ```

## Insights and Comments

### CO2 Emissions Growth
- The analysis reveals a notable reduction in CO2 emissions for high-income countries post-2010.
- Per capita emissions, however, still highlight considerable carbon production in high-income nations.

### CO2 Emission Share by Country
- The bar plots showcase changes in the top 5 emitting countries, emphasizing the roles of China and India.
- Normalizing for population size provides additional insights into the distribution of emissions.

### Wealth Inequality Development
- Violin plots display the evolution of GDP per capita distribution, indicating overall economic growth.
- Despite improvements, wealth disparities among countries persist.
